# What is this?

From the (now unavailable) [project page](http://svn.ask.it.usyd.edu.au/trac/candc):

>  The first full version of the C&C tools, version 1.00, has been released! The tools consist of the C&C CCG parser -- including the computational semantics tool, Boxer -- and the C&C taggers. (The tools also use the morphological analyser morpha.)

> The tools have been developed by James Curran and Stephen Clark. Boxer has been developed by Johan Bos. Both the parser and taggers are written in C++ and are efficient enough to be used for large-scale Natural Language Processing tasks.

> The tools are released under an academic (non-commercial) licence. If you are interested in a commercial licence then please email candc@it.usyd.edu.au.

> In order to download the tools you will need to register. The documentation pages contain descriptions of the tools, but please email us if there is something missing. The FAQ page contains some frequently asked questions.

# Availability

The project page went down sometime in early 2016. Ever since then, here and there a number of people provided download links to the original 1.0 release of C&C. Most notably, probably, [chbrown](https://github.com/chbrown) [here](https://github.com/chbrown/candc).

# This repository

In this repository I want to provided access to the original release sources and all the changes that were pushed to the SVN trunk but never made it into an official release. Also, potentially, I'd like to include my own changes to the C&C sources. Here, with much gratitude, many thanks to [texttheater](https://github.com/texttheater), who provided the sources to the **2614M** SVN version of C&C.

# License

The original license is included. I'd be very grateful for any help with making it compatible (or checking compatibility in the first place) with a modern (and not hand-tailored) license.
